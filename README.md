# Text To Audio
 An applescript that converts text to spoken audio as AIFF audio files.

This was created to quickly produce speech sample data for talking electronics. The script can break text files by line, word or character and produce an AIFF file of the realist in any of the Mac system voices. You can optionally set speech options or keep the defaults, which are roughly equivalent to 'normal' English human speech.

In future I'd like to add the ability to automatically export the file to 1 or more audio formats, but I have not yet found a way to successfully run an audio conversion utility, even a command-line one, from an AppleScript.
